# Vue Design System

**Vue Design System** is an open source tool for building UI Design Systems with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org). It provides you and your team a set of organized tools, patterns & practices that work as the foundation for your application development.

The tool is built on top of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), [Vue Styleguidist](https://github.com/vue-styleguidist/vue-styleguidist), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org), and [Theo](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/theo) and is aimed for designers and front-end developers who have at least basic knowledge of component based workflows + HTML, SCSS & JavaScript.

**Made by [@viljamis](https://twitter.com/viljamis) and other contributors. See also [the official website](https://vueds.com) of Vue Design System and [read my article](https://viljamis.com/2018/vue-design-system/) on the processes and workflow I use to get started with a new design system project.**

## Features

- A set of interconnected patterns & practices for you and your team.
- A well thought-out terminology, naming conventions, and hierarchy.
- Get an automated overview of how your design system progresses over time.
- Global design tokens in YAML format that you can use inside any component.
- Automatic generation of living, user editable documentation.
- Easily export and use your Design System as an NPM dependency in another Vue.js or Nuxt.js project.
- Create a token, an element, or a pattern, and it’s immediately available across all components.
- Pre-configured Prettier setup for auto-formatting code on both save and before commit.
- Live Reloading, Autoprefixing, SCSS, and helper functions + simple and sane defaults for SVG and Webfont usage out-of-the-box.
- Documentation and the app logic are separated, so you can have public docs while the app itself stays private.
